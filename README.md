# cpp-basics

## Overview
This repository contains C++ programs and notes covering fundamental concepts, practice questions, and pattern problems. It is organized for easy learning and revision, with code examples for each topic.

## Folder Structure

- `C++/` : Core C++ notes, functions, OOPs, and pattern programs.
	- `functions/` : Programs demonstrating function basics, sum, factorial, prime check, Fibonacci, swapping, etc.
	- `oops/` : Object-Oriented Programming concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, constructors, destructors, friend functions, operator overloading, etc.
	- `patterns/` : Various pattern printing programs using loops and characters.
- `C++ Practice Questions/` : Practice problems for functions, bitwise operators, conversions, and more patterns.

## C++ Basics

- **Variables & Data Types**: int, double, char, string, bool, etc.
- **Input/Output**: `cin`, `cout` for reading and printing values.
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, increment/decrement.
- **Control Structures**: if-else, switch, for, while, do-while loops.
- **Functions**: Declaration, definition, parameters, arguments, return types, call by value/reference.

---

## Functions

- **Basic Functions**: Sum, min/max, factorial, sum of digits, Fibonacci, prime check, swapping numbers.
- **Parameter Passing**: Demonstrates call by value (original variables do not change).
- **Return Types**: int, double, bool, tuple (for swapping), void (for printing only).
- **Examples**:
	- Sum of two numbers
	- Factorial of a number
	- Sum of N natural numbers
	- Check if a number is prime
	- Print all primes up to N
	- nth Fibonacci number
	- Swap two numbers using tuple
	- Binary to decimal and decimal to binary conversion

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)

- **Class & Object**: How to define a class, create objects, and access members.
- **Member Functions**: Defined inside and outside the class.
- **Inline Functions**: Functions defined with `inline` keyword for faster execution.
- **Friend Functions**: Functions that can access private members of a class.
- **Constructors & Destructors**: Special functions for object initialization and cleanup.
- **Inheritance**: Single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid inheritance with examples.
- **Operator Overloading**: Overloading unary and binary operators.
- **Static Members**: Shared among all objects of a class.

---

## Patterns

- **Number Patterns**: Square, triangle, pyramid, Floyd's triangle, etc.
- **Character Patterns**: Using alphabets in various shapes.
- **Star Patterns**: Butterfly, hollow diamond, S-shape, etc.
- **Logic**: Use of nested loops, conditionals, and arithmetic for pattern generation.

---

## Bitwise Operators

- **AND, OR, XOR, NOT, Shift Operators**: Examples and practice problems.
- **Applications**: Power of two check, bit manipulation tricks.

---

## Practice Questions

- **Conditional Statements**: Uppercase/lowercase check, sum of odd/even numbers, numbers divisible by 3, etc.
- **Functions**: Factorial, sum, prime, Fibonacci, conversions, sum of digits, reverse integer, etc.
- **Patterns**: Various pattern printing for practice.

## How to Use

1. Browse the folders for topic-wise code and notes.
2. Compile and run `.cpp` files using any C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++, MSVC).
3. Refer to `notes.md` and markdown files for theory and explanations.
4. Use pattern and function files for practice and revision.
